# Working with results

> This chapter covers what comes from [find](find_functions.md) and [search](search.md) requests.

For all chapters below we will us a data example inserted in the elasticsearch content type:

```
// content type

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Dr. Damien Yundt DVM"
},
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Zane Heidenreich IV"
},
{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "Hattie Shields MD"
}

```

## Results iterator

Whenever any search actions is performed and `Result::RESULTS_OBJECT` is selected as the result type the `DocumentIterator` will be returned. It has plenty of helper functions to aggregate more efficiently with the results.


Lets assume you search the index with:

```php

$repo = $this->get('es.manager.default.content');
$search = $repo->createSearch();
$termQuery = new MatchAllQuery();
$results = $repo->execute($search, Result::RESULTS_OBJECT); // Result::RESULTS_OBJECT is the default value

```

So all 3 content elements will be found. `DocumentIterator`implements [`\Countable`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.countable.php), [`\Iterator`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php) interfaces functions. The results are traversable and you can run `foreach` cycle through it.

```php

echo $results->count() . "\n";

/** @var AppBundle:Content $document */
foreach ($results as $document) {
    echo $document->title . "\n";
}

```

it will print:

```
3
Dr. Damien Yundt DVM
Zane Heidenreich IV
Hattie Shields MD
```

### Getting Document Score

In most cases Elasticsearch returns result score (`_score` field) for each document.
As this score might be different per search it's not treated as document field and
cannot be associated with document. You can get document's score from results iterator
while iterating:

```php
$results = $repository->execute($search);

foreach ($results as $document) {
    echo $document->title, $results->getDocumentScore();
}
```

Example above prints titles of all documents following search score.

#### Important notice

`DocumentIterator` doesn't cache or store generated document object. `Converter` directly returns the instance after it's requested and will generate again if it will be requested.

We highly recommend to `unset()` document instance after you dont need it or manage memory at your own way.

There is possible to change the `DocumentIterator` behaviour. Take a look at the [overwriting bundle parts](overwriting_bundle.md).
